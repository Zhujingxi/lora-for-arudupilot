# lora-for-arudupilot
The Lora RT is design for ardupilot
This project is using LORA moudle as the base of mavlink, Which will provide low byte long distance communication.
In the city it capable 1km communication within some buliding between. In the open area it can capable about 5km communication.
!!!IMPORTANT!!!
Due to it using lora, so there isn't a lot of bandwidth. You can't use it do transfer a lots of data. I recommand set misstion planner sampling rate lower than 15 each.
Do not use it for controler too, due to it's  high lag.
